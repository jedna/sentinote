Sentinote converts your notes into WordPress posts or pages. Keep using Evernote and when you’re ready to publish assign the “published” tag.
== Description ==
Sentinote provides a complete Evernote integration solution for WordPress. It allows you to quickly make changes to your website or blog by simply typing notes inside Evernote.

### Note: Seeking contributor. 

### Features:  

* Easy publishing to your WordPress website using Evernote.  
    * Create a blog post by tagging your note with “published”.  
    * Create a page by tagging your note with “published” and “page”.  
* Your Evernote notes, thus your website, are always backed up by Evernote.  
* Extend your website features with WordPress plugins and themes.  
* Use plugin/theme shortcodes inside your Evernote notes.  
* Markdown and Markdown Extra support.  
* Collaborative reviewing by sharing your Evernote notebook.  
* Collaborative editing of your website by giving write access to your shared Evernote notebook (Evernote Premium Feature).  
* Sentinote updates will automatically show up in your WordPress dashboard (for valid license holders only).  

### Requirements:  

* An Evernote account.  
* A self-/hosted WordPress website (Not a WordPress.com website. They don’t support 3rd party plugins)  
* Evernote’s tools require that your website runs PHP 5.3 or higher. Most hosting providers meet this requirement although some hosts do not enable this by default. A simple support ticket to your provider will do the trick. 

### Documentation: 

Sentinote documentation can be found at <http://sentinote.com/documentation/>  

== Installation ==
After installing you will need to get an Evernote Developer token.

Follow the instructions on the \"Evernote Extension\" tab.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
**I get an error when I install the plugin: Invalid T_STRING.**  
You need to be running PHP 5.3 or higher.  

**My notes are not showing up.**  
Make sure that you have typed your Evernote notebook name exactly as it appears in Evernote.  Also make sure that your note is tagged with \'published\'.  

**Can I use Evernote for Business?**  
You can use an Evernote for Business account, but at the moment Sentinote does not work with Business Notebooks.  

**Help! Parts of my notes are disappearing in WordPress.**  
This is a known Evernote issue thats been bugging people for a long time (since 2010). Each Evernote client embeds its own syntax into the notes to make use of the features of the clients. The most notable client to create issues is the Windows client. See <http://sentinote.com/2014/04/windows-users/> for some help.
